        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-me-content">Since graduating from my Masters Degree in Computing Science I have obtained around two years of development
            experience. I was a Python developer for a year before moving to AND Digital. My main skills lie within full
            stack technologies such as React, NodeJS and, the technology I have most experience in, Python. I am known
            for having a great deal of experience in improving agile practices and clean code standards and also in
            creating RESTful APIs. I am also a huge advocate of constant improvement so I always look to learn from and
            teach those around me. Therefore, I have had a great impact on each project I’ve worked on and on the people
            around me. I had such a great impact that I was selected by a client to work as a tech coach in order to
            upskill their offshore developers. After this I was singled out for extremely positive feedback by a senior
            stakeholder in the client company. I have many interests outside traditional web development such as data
            science and tech coaching and I try to upskill myself as much as possible in these areas in my free
            time.</p>
